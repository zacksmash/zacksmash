### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Zack! I'm a full-stack PHP developer in the Greater Salt Lake Area, Utah. I'm the Co-Founder of [Schematik](https://schematik.io), a web softwar development and technical consulting firm. We build sites, apps, software and we help make sure you're getting the most out of every line in your codebase.

I love working in Laravel, VueJS, Statamic and Wordpress. I love creating automation tools to make developing easier and more fun. Let's work on a project together!
